# dataverse-scripts  

- Scripts for processing geospatial files for dataverse 
- Scripts for pre-processing geospatial files for the bounding-box/extent data  

For now I'm using jupyter notebooks to work out the scripts.


# get_lariac_info.ipynb  
creates a csv of the files currently in the lariac4 folder,  these happen to be .las files
All libraries can be added with pip
- **pyDataverse**
- datetime
- os
- pprint
